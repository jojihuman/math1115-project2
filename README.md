MATH1115 Project 2, Report on Flight Data using R and tidyverse

Note: This project is to be completed individually.

**Part 1: Written Report** 

For a given dataset, pose a stakeholder, and then investigate a relevant research question. 
Write a report for that stakeholder, showcasing everything you have learnt in MATH1115. 
Submit a .html produced from a .Rmd. 

**Part 2: Presentation with Live Interrogation** 

Present a 2 minute (maximum) report. This is the '2 minute challenge', a super important skill to learn (i.e. you need to develop the skill of talking concisvely and persuasively).  

Design your 2 minute talk for your chosen stakeholder.
Practise your presentation at home with a timer. It should not feel rushed, rather it should be at a nice, measured professional speed. 
This can be done through a video presentation and shared or live on Zoom during lab time.
At the end of your presentation, you will have a live interrogation where your peers and tutor will respectfully ask you questions.  Stay calm and answer what you know - there is no problem with saying 'That's a good question but requires further investigation' (i.e. don't fake your answers). 

*COVID-19 update: The live interrogation has been cancelled.*

**Part 3: Specific interrogation of another student's work (submit Monday, Week 11)**

During the presentations, pick another student with a different research question from yours. 
Redo this research question in your own way keeping in mind questions like these:
Have you answered the research question in the same way or an alternative way?
Do you agree with the other student's conclusions? Why/Why not?
